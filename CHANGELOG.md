## 4.0.1

- Remove unused values from publish

## 4.0.0

Rewrite! Lots of changes under-the-hood for a much more consistent hash, and circular object
handling out of the box.

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- `isEmpty`, `isEqual`,`isNull`, and `isUndefined` have been removed (all can be reproduced with new
  `is` and `is.all` functions)
  - `hash.isNull` => `hash.is(null)`
  - `hash.isUndefined` => `hash.is(undefined)`
  - `hash.isEqual` => `hash.is.all`
  - `hash.isEmpty` =>
    `(object) => hash.is.any(object, undefined, null, '', 0, [], {}, new Map(), new Set())`
- `Error` hashes now based on `error.stack` instead of `error.message`

#### ENHANCEMENTS

- Circular objects are now handled out of the box, thanks to
  [`fast-stringify`](https://github.com/planttheidea/fast-stringify)
- Collision rates are near-zero (previously used traditional DJB2, which has small collision rates)
- Better `ArrayBuffer` support with the use of `Buffer.from` when supported
- SVG elements, DocumentFragments, and Events are now supported
- `is` partial-application function allows for easy creation of any type of `isEqual` comparison
  method
- `is.any` performs the same multiple-object check that `is.all` does, but only checks if one of the
  other objects is equal
- `is.not` performs the same comparison that `is` does, but checks for non-equality

#### FIXES

- `Object` / `Map` / `Set` no longer returns different hashes based on order of key addition
- `hash.isEqual` will no longer fail if nothing is passed

## 3.1.2

- Remove extraneous `toString` call (performance)

## 3.1.1

- Improve hash uniqueness for HTML elements

## 3.1.0

- Add support for `Generator` (not just `GeneratorFunction`)
- Streamline `typeof`- vs `toString`-driven handling for improved speed for most types

## 3.0.0

- Improve speed (2-4x faster depending on type)
- Smaller footprint (~25% reduction)
- Improve hash accuracy for functions (hash now includes function body)
- Fix issue where stack remained in memory after hash was built
- Add ES transpilation for module-ready build tools

#### BREAKING CHANGES

- If using CommonJS, you need to specify `require('hash-it').default` instead of just
  `require('hash-it')`
- Hashes themselves may have changed (especially for circular objects)
- Removed `isRecursive` method on `hashIt` object (which was wrongly named to begin with)
  - To specifically handle _circular_ objects (which is what it really did), pass `true` as the
    second parameter to `hashIt`

## 2.1.2

- Move up isNull check in replacer (improve performance of more likely use-case)

## 2.1.1

- Create isNull utility instead of checking strict equality in multiple places

## 2.1.0

- Overall speed improvement by an average of 18.74% (35.27% improvement on complex objects)

## 2.0.1

- More speed improvements

## 2.0.0

- Use JSON.stringify with replacer as default, without try/catch
- Move use of try/catch with fallback to prune to new `hashIt.withRecursion` method (only necessary
  for deeply-recursive objects like `window`)
- Reorder switch statement for commonality of use cases
- Leverage typeof in switch statements when possible for performance

## 1.3.1

- Add optimize-js plugin for performance in script version

## 1.3.0

- Add hashIt.isUndefined, hashIt.isNull, and hashIt.isEmpty methods
- Reorder switch statements in replacer and getValueForStringification to reflect most likely to
  least likely (improves performance a touch)
- Remove "Number" from number stringification
- Leverage prependTypeToString whereever possible
- Include Arguments object class

## 1.2.1

- Calculation of Math hashCode now uses properties
- Fix README

## 1.2.0

- Add hashIt.isEqual method to test for equality
- Prepend all values not string or number with object class name to help avoid collision with
  equivalent string values

## 1.1.0

- Add support for a variety of more object types
- Fix replacer not using same stringifier for int arrays

## 1.0.0

- Initial release
