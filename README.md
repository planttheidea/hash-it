## Usage

```javascript
// ES2015
import hash from 'hash-it';

// CommonJS
const hash = require('hash-it');

// hash any standard object
console.log(hash({ foo: 'bar' })); // 13729774857125

// or a circular object
console.log(hash(window)); // 3270731309314
```

## Overview

`hash-it` has a simple goal: provide a fast, consistent, unique hashCode for any object type that is uniquely based on its values. This has a number of uses such as duplication prevention, equality comparisons, blockchain construction, etc.

_Any object type?_

Yes, any object type. Primitives, ES2015 classes like `Symbol`, DOM elements (yes, you can even hash the `window` object if you want). Any object type.

_With no exceptions?_

Well ... sadly, no, there are a few exceptions.

- `Promise`
  - There is no way to obtain the values contained within due to its asynchronous nature
- `Generator` (the result of calling a `GeneratorFunction`)
  - Like `Promise`, there is no way to obtain the values contained within due to its dynamic iterable nature
- `WeakMap` / `WeakRef` / `WeakSet`
  - The spec explicitly forbids iteration over them, so the unique values cannot be discovered

For each of these object types, the object will have a unique hash based on the object reference itself:

```ts
const promise = Promise.resolve(123);

console.log(hash(promise)); // 16843037491939
console.log(hash(promise)); // 16843037491939
console.log(hash(Promise.resolve(123))); // 4622327363876
```

Notice even if the internal values of the object are the same, the hash is different. This is because the values of the above object types cannot be introspected.

Here is the list of object classes that produce consistent, unique hashes based on their value:

- `Arguments`
- `Array`
- `ArrayBuffer`
- `AsyncFunction` (based on `toString`)
- `AsyncGeneratorFunction` (based on `toString`)
- `BigInt`
- `BigInt64Array`
- `BigUint64Array`
- `Boolean`
- `DataView` (based on its `buffer`)
- `Date` (based on `getTime`)
- `DocumentFragment` (based on `outerHTML` of all `children`)
- `Error` (based on `stack`)
  - Includes all sub-types (e.g., `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, etc.)
- `Event` (based on all properties other than `Event.timeStamp`)
  - Includes all sub-types (e.g., `MouseEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, etc.)
- `Float32Array`
- `Float64Array`
- `Function` (based on `toString`)
- `GeneratorFunction` (based on `toString`)
- `Int8Array`
- `Int16Array`
- `Int32Array`
- `HTMLElement` (based on `outerHTML`)
  - Includes all sub-types (e.g., `HTMLAnchorElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, etc.)
- `Map` (order-agnostic)
- `Null`
- `Number`
- `Object` (handles circular objects, order-agnostic)
- `Proxy`
- `RegExp`
- `Set` (order-agnostic)
- `SharedArrayBuffer`
- `String`
- `SVGElement` (based on `outerHTML`)
  - Includes all sub-types (e.g., `SVGRectElement`, `SVGPolygonElement`, etc.)
- `Symbol` (based on `toString`)
- `Uint8Array`
- `Uint8ClampedArray`
- `Uint16Array`
- `Uint32Array`
- `Undefined`
- `Window`

If there is an object class or data type that is missing, please submit an issue.

## Hash consistency

While the hashes will be consistent when calculated within the same environment, there is no guarantee that the resulting hash will be the same across different environments due to environment-specific or browser-specific implementations of features. This is limited to extreme edge cases, such as hashing the `window` object, but should be considered if being used with persistence over different environments.
